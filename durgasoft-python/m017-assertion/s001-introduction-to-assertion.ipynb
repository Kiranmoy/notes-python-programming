    "Debugging python program by using **assert** keyword:\n",
    "* The process of identifying and fixing the bug is called **debugging**.\n",
    "* A very common way of debugging is to use a **`print( )`** statement.\n",
    "* But the problem with the **`print()`** statement is after fixing the bug, compulsory that we have to delete the extra added **`print( )`** statements, otherwise these will be executed at runtime which creates performance problems and disturbs console output.\n",
    "* To overcome this problem we should go for an assert statement. \n",
    "* The main advantage of an assert statement over a **`print( )`** statement is after fixing the bug we are not required to delete assert statements. \n",
    "* Based on our requirements we can enable or disable assert statements.\n",
    "* **The main purpose of assertions is to perform debugging**.\n",
    "* Usually, we can perform debugging either in development or in test environments but not in production environments.\n",
    "* Hence assertions concept is applicable only to dev and test environments but not to the production environment."
